# QuantaQuilida

## About QuantaQuilida
QuantaQuilida is a sophisticated monitoring and advisory application designed to ensure the quality, reliability, and alignment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It performs rigorous quality control and verification on LLM-generated content by cross-referencing outputs with trusted data sources to assess truthfulness, reduce bias, and ensure factual accuracy. As a key component of the PrismQuanta ecosystem, QuantaQuilida provides essential oversight for multi-agent systems, ensuring they operate within ethical and operational boundaries.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of QuantaQuilida is to provide a robust framework for the verification and validation of LLM-generated content. This includes:
- **Ensuring Factual Accuracy:** Cross-referencing LLM outputs with a curated set of trusted knowledge bases.
- **Identifying and Mitigating Bias:** Analyzing content for biases and providing actionable insights for correction.
- **Monitoring Agent Behavior:** Tracking the performance and behavior of LLM agents to ensure alignment with predefined objectives.
- **Providing Actionable Advisories:** Delivering real-time alerts and detailed reports to human overseers and other agents.

## Key Features
- **Automated Fact-Checking:** Modules that automatically verify claims against trusted data sources.
- **Bias and Consistency Analysis:** Tools to detect and measure bias and ensure consistent outputs.
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Mechanisms to monitor and guide the interactions of multiple LLM agents.
- **Advisory and Alignment Modules:** Components that provide guidance to LLM agents to keep them aligned with their goals.
- **Detailed Quality Reports:** Comprehensive reports on the quality and accuracy of LLM-generated content.

## Roadmap
Our development plan is divided into several phases, from initial scoping and design to the implementation of advanced features. For more details, please see our [Development Plan](docs/plan.md). We also have a list of [Future Enhancements](docs/enhancements.md) that we plan to explore.

## Current Status
QuantaQuilida is currently in the planning and design phase. The core concepts have been defined, and the development roadmap is being finalized. The initial implementation is underway.

## Getting Started
As the project is in its early stages, there are no build or installation instructions yet. Please check back for updates.
