# Development Plan for QuantaQuilida

This document outlines the development plan for QuantaQuilida, organized into distinct phases.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality
The first phase focuses on establishing the foundational components of the application.

- **Define App Scope and Target LLM Use Cases:**
  - Identify the primary LLM architectures and use cases that QuantaQuilida will support.
  - Define the specific quality metrics to be enforced (e.g., factual accuracy, bias levels, consistency).

- **Design Core Architecture:**
  - Design the main application architecture, including data processing pipelines and APIs.
  - Select the initial set of trusted knowledge bases for fact-checking.

- **Implement Initial Modules:**
  - Develop the first version of the fact-checking and bias analysis modules.
  - Implement a basic reporting mechanism to present findings.

## Phase 2: Advanced Features and Integration
The second phase will build upon the core functionality to add more advanced capabilities and integrations.

- **Implement Monitoring and Alerting:**
  - Develop a real-time monitoring system for LLM agent behavior.
  - Implement a configurable alerting mechanism to notify overseers of critical issues.

- **Develop Advisory and Alignment Modules:**
  - Create modules that can provide real-time guidance to LLM agents.
  - Implement mechanisms to ensure agents remain aligned with their operational goals.

- **Integrate Multi-Agent Coordination:**
  - Develop features to support the monitoring and coordination of multi-agent systems.
  - Design and implement workflows for collaborative agent tasks.
